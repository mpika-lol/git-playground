This is a public repository which can be used to practice forking a repository, and trying to contribute back by opening a pull request.

It contains a slide show with an introduction to the main features of `git` (in Markdown source format). To automatically create a pdf-document from it, one can use the command `make` on a commandline. (Assuming that the commandline tool `pandoc` and `make` are installed.)

This is an added sentence. Fun fact: Goldfish are cute
